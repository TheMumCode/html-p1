<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey!<br>
I'm TheMumCode, here's my not so fancy pants HTML website <br>
that I'm doing as part of the AppBrewary Bootcamp and Angela Yu</p>

<p>I am totally new to Coding and would like to <br> 
 become a website developer or software engineer at <br>
 at some point.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Digital Marketing trainer so think it makes<br> 
sense to upskill and teach my students more about Coding</p>

<p>Even if the world does think that ChatGPT is taking over the world</p>

<p>I'd like to thinkk we can create loads more by utilising both coding and ai</p>

<p>Anywho, hopefully I'll get much better and quicker at this!</p>
<p>Much Love <br>

The Mum Code</p>
